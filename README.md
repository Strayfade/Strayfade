*Creating mediocre programs running in C++, C#, JavaScript, and occasionally Python.*
### Notable repositories:
 - **WindowsActivator** - Activates any version of Windows 10, for free, systematically.
 - **WebScraping** - Open-Source (and easy to use) customizable Javascript application to pull information from the internet.
 - **TwitterFortniteNews** - Uses a Python script to grab NEWS data from EpicGames, then uses Javascript to post it on Twitter!
 - **SpanishCrawler** - Experimental WebCrawler application to grab spanish words and their definitions from StudySpanish.com!
 - **CenterTaskbar** - (*Forked from mdhiggins/CenterTaskbar*) Center Windows Taskbar Icons.
 - **ProgramHider** - Hides Programs Bruv. Hide your programs from your classmates and colleagues with this nifty thing.
 - **InternalBhop** - Long-lost remnant of my game-hacking days in C++
